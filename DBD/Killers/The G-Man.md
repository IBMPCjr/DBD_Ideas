##### Power: Cascade Aftermath
Press and hold the *Power button* to activate *Cascade Aftermath*.

Using *Cascade Aftermath* depletes The G-Man's power gauge (20 seconds). It will automatically replenish over time (20 seconds). 

*Cascade Aftermath* allows several **Special Actions**. 

###### Special Action: Interdimensional Doorway
While near an unbroken *Breakable Wall*, press the *Secondary ability button* while in *Cascade Aftermath* to begin linking doorways. While linking doorways, the aura of all unbroken *breakable walls* are visible. Pressing the *Secondary ability button* while aiming at a *Breakable wall* links the 2 walls for 60 seconds. Traveling through linked doorways will completely drain your power gauge. You may only travel through linked doorways while using your power.

###### Special Action: Time Dilation
Pressing the *Secondary ability button* while no other **Special Action** is available will activate *Time Dilation*. While *Time Dilation* is active, you're movement speed is increased to 200%. However, this drains your *Power gauge* 3 times faster than normal.

###### Special Action: Time Reversal
Pressing the *Secondary ability button* while near a dropped pallet will reset said pallet, and block it for 15 seconds. This drains 1/3 of your power gauge.
