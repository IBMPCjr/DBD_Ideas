**The Steppe Archer** is a ranged Killer, able to use his power, **Steppe Archery**, to shoot arrows at survivors to injure and debuff them from a distance. His personal perks, **Vicious Hunter**, **Mongolian Ferocity**, and **Scourge of the East**, allow him to chase his prey more effectively and apply pressure on generators from a distance.

His perks revolve around tracking his prey more effectively, allowing him to follow survivors 

##### Weapon: Mongolian Saber
The **Mongolian Saber** is the Primary Weapon of **The Steppe Archer**. An elegant blade made of hardened steel, with a birch handle and a bone pommel. 

##### Power: Steppe Archery
Press and hold the *Power button* for ==1 seconds== to notch and draw back an arrow.
Release the *Power button* to shoot the arrow.
- Start the trial with ==**10 arrows**.==
- Releasing the *Power button* before the arrow is fully drawn will cancel the draw, returning the arrow to your reserve.
- Arrows travel at ==60 m/s==
- Survivors can only be inflected with ==3 arrows== at a time
- Arrows start being effected by drop-off at 28 meters

Arrows cannot down a Survivor. The first will injure, the second will inflect **Deep Wound**, and the third will inflict 5% **Hindered**. Before a survivor can *mend*, they must remove the arrows from their person. Each arrow takes ==1 second== to remove.

Shot arrows will stick into static surfaces and Survivors. Once stuck, the arrow will glow white. Arrows stuck into Survivors will only glow 3 seconds after they have been removed. Arrows that have hit dynamic objects, and arrows that have been removed from Survivors, will be on the ground near where they hit. These arrows will also glow. Picking up a survivor in the dying state who has arrows in them will automatically return the arrows to your reserve.

### Perks

##### Vicious Hunter
---
The thrill of the hunt is so great, you break your connection to The Entity while tracking your prey. This perk removes your ability to see scratch marks. Instead, you see footprints. Footprints are slightly visible/moderately visible/considerably visible. Walking will make footprints less consistent. This perk is not effected by perks that remove scratch marks. This perk is effected by Lightweight. Self-aware allows survivors to see their footprints.

*"You're tricks won't work on me!"* (Chase Perk)
##### Mongolian Ferocity
---
When a survivor blinds you, you gain a *10% haste* effect for ==5/10/15 seconds==. The blind is 25% shorter. When Lightborn is taken with this perk, this perk deactivates.

*"Foolish child, you're just delaying the inevitable!"* (Misc. Perk)
##### Scourge of the East
---
When a regressing generator is in your terror radius, those generator regresses ==20%== faster, and their aura is visible to you. This effect lingers for 1/2/3 seconds after the effected generator is no longer in the terror radius.

*"All will fear me! Living and dead, man and machine."* (Gen. Perk)
